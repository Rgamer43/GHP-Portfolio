#Dataraider
Unity, C#
Dataraider is a video game I made. I've only added the code, not the rest of the Unity files. It can be downloaded from https://rgamer43.itch.io/dataraider

#Midnight Dusk
Unity, C#
Midnight Dusk is a video game I worked on with several friends. I did most of the code, but some of it was done by my friend Owen. Only the code files have been added. I'm most proud of DungeonGenerator.cs. SaveManager.cs is also neat.
